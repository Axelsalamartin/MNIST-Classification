# MNIST-Classification
Using a 1 layer perceptron first and then a multi layer perceptron to see the improvements in the task execution.

They both take few seconds to train (on 2000 training steps).

Few twists on the learning rate, optimizer, number of iterations even add dropout could improve the model but to really get higher accuracy : a convolutionnal network would be a good way to go since it's know to best extract features in image classification task.
